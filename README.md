# welcome to my github

## about me
if this was a real github, i would put my name and major, but this will never get accessed by the public.  in fact, if anyone sees this, there's an 80% chance that they are a data structures student, who, mid-cheating, clicked on rohan's bio.  every single thing on here is a joke.  in my free time i enjoy building snowmen and cancelling people on twitter.  my profile picture is from the 8th grade DC trip, about five years ago at this point.  i will now make a list of all my repositories.  

## repositories

- ### [python madness](https://github.com/deadfishh/python-madness)
  i am trying to learn python.  i can confidently say that i know the same amount of python as i do java, which is not much.  
- ### [senior projects](https://github.com/deadfishh/senior-shit)
  the personality test for ap lit and the chadbot for linear algebra.  i was the original chat gpt, but instead of being helpful, it was puchovich telling you to listen to the alvin and the chipmunks soundtrack (slowed down) or matt lowry reminding you of the ap grader motto (no mercy!!)
- ### [stem](https://github.com/deadfishh/stem)
  the main character of my whole github.  i sure do love this website <3
- ### [java games](https://github.com/deadfishh/games)
  from when i would practice java by making fun games with no objects at all, like battleship or wordle.  there's also the most fun games of all, leontief matrixes and LU factorization!!! numpy who???
- ### [dialog boxes](https://github.com/deadfishh/dialog-boxes)
  dialog boxes are fun, i enjoyed making these.  there's quizlet, name every ____, and other things.  i enjoy listing things off and memorizing lists, as seen in some of the stem "directories".  
- ### [data structures](https://github.com/deadfishh/data-structures)
  the stuff from cwru data structures, aka csds 233.  they all work and that's about as good as it's gonna get.  everything is written in java but there's also the python translations in my python madness repo.
