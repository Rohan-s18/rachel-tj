# welcome to my github

## about me
if this was a real github, i would put my name and major, but this will never get accessed by the public.  every single thing on here is a joke.  in my free time i enjoy building snowmen and cancelling people on twitter.  i will now make a list of all my repositories.  

## repositories

- [python madness](link)
- [senior projects](link)
- [stem](link)
- [java games](link)
